    <h1>Welcome to</h1>
    <h1>The <span class="orange">Wayne</span> Foundation</h1>
    <h3>I am super Rich</h3>
    <p>I am the only son of the prestigious Wayne family of Gotham and also the only successor of my dad's super big business. One night I was out with my parents in the city of gotham and a guy with funny makeups and red smiley lipstick crossed our path and killed my parents. Somehow I got away that day. I was raised by Wayne family's old caretaker Alfred. This guy seems to born like an old dude. Now I run the business of Wayne Foundation built by my dad. I like partying, dancing, drunk girls and buying random stuffs to prove <b>I AM RICHH!</b></p>
